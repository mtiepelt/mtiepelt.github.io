I am currently a [cryptographer](https://crypto.iti.kit.edu/english/staff_marcel_tiepelt.php) at the [KASTEL Cryptography and Research Group](https://crypto.iti.kit.edu/english/index.php) in Karlsruhe, Germany. 

My primary research focus encompasses the comprehensive cryptanalysis of **post-quantum cryptography** providing both, attacks on candidates of the NIST competition as well as rigorous security estimation techniques. Most recently, I enjoy working on provable security, such as **quantum-annoying**'ness in password authenticated key exchange. 

On the practical side, I work on **mutually authenticated key exchange**. I collaboration with the [German Aerospace Center](https://www.dlr.de/en) I worked on the MAKE procedure of [LDACS](https://www.ldacs.com/), Europeâ€™s next-generation civil aviation communication system. 

My list of [Publications]({% link Pages/Research.md%}#publications) and other [Talks]({% link Pages/Community.md%}#talks) are available online.

I am part of the managing body of [Fachgruppe KRYPTO](https://fg-krypto.gi.de/) of the German Informatics Society. We organize summerschools and networking events every year. You can find more [information]({% link Pages/Community.md%}#community) here.

In my free time I love to [cook]({% link Pages/AboutMe.md %}#cook) and visit new [places]({% link Pages/AboutMe.md %}#travel). A piece of free advice: Never take the same path twice!
