# About Me

Currently I am a [researcher](https://crypto.iti.kit.edu/english/staff_marcel_tiepelt.php) at the  of the [KASTEL Cryptography and Research Group](https://crypto.iti.kit.edu/english/index.php). 

My research interest are crypt-analysis, post-quantum cryptography and quantum-annoying PAKEs. 

I love to travel and explore new cultures, and I use to have [travel blog](https://itfortheworld.wordpress.com/) which I will continue here soon.
