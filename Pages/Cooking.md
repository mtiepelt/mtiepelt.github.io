## Dampfnudeln

These tasty German steamed dumplings can be served both salty and sweet. In  the following I will only consider the savory variants. 
I am trying to find the **perfect** recipe, which should result in fluffy but moist dumplings with some texture. 

There are several variables to consider such as:

1. Ratio of ingredients
2. Type of flour
3. Resting time for dough and yeast

### Ingredients 

My current baseline for ingredient-ratio is:
* 10 Flour
* 5 Milk
* 2 Butter
* 0.5 sugar 
* 0.027 salt (about 27g for 1kg of flour)


### Flour

In Germany, there are several types of flour available which are sorted by the type of grass (e.g. wheat) and a different amount (a number) of minerals. Larger number usually have more (or "larger" chunks?) of minerals. 

So far I have tried the following:

Wheat
* 1050 
* 550 
* 450 
* 00 

Rye:
* 997
* 1150 

Spelt: 
* 630 
* 1050

### State-of-the-Art

From an independent survey which a sample group of eight people it appears that the two favorites are:

1. Wheat, 00 ("pizza-flour"), with 20% of flour exchanged for semolina)
2. Wheat, 550
